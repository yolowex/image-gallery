# Foto Folio - Image and Video Gallery/Editor

Foto Folio is a fully featured Image and Video gallery/editor made with Pygame Community Edition. It allows you to manage your images and videos efficiently and even perform basic editing tasks on your photos. The app runs on Windows and Linux, and it should also work on Mac, although it hasn't been extensively tested on that platform.

## Features

* View and manage images and videos in a user-friendly interface.
* Copy, cut, delete, and rename contents.
* Create new folders to organize your media collection.
* Edit and enhance photos (not videos) with basic editing tools.
* Tag people in a picture to easily organize them by subjects.
* Modify location and caption tags for better organization.
* Play videos (Note: video playback is laggy due to limitations in python threading).
* Play gifs for a more dynamic experience.

## Libraries Used

Foto Folio was built using the following libraries:

* Pygame Community Edition (pygame-ce): A faster and better-maintained fork of the popular Pygame library, used for handling graphics and user input in the app.
* OpenCV (opencv-python): An open-source computer vision and image processing library.
* Pillow: A friendly fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), used for image processing tasks.
* Tkinter: Python's standard GUI library for creating the graphical user interface.
* SQLite3: A lightweight and serverless database engine used for storing application data.
* MoviePy: A library for video editing and processing.
