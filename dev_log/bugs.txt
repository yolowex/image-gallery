bug#1 details:
    level: critical
    state: fixed

    while switching to fullscreen view from the detailed view,
    an error is raised. this happens when the zoom_in or zoom_out
    buttons are unintentionally pressed.
    it only happens on the first switch.

    this was fixed by calling update and check_event methods before performing zoom in
    and zoom out in the zoom_function.

bug#2 details:
    level: normal
    state: fixed

    while switching the gallery mode from detailed to fullscreen and vice versa,
    the picture is not shown until the mouse is hovered over the image box.

    this was fixed by calling update and check_event methods before performing zoom in
    and zoom out in the zoom_function.

bug#3 details:
    level: normal
    state: unsolved

    while changing the current picture, the aspect ratio and size of the new picture is
    the same as the last picture.

    this can probably be fixed easily.

bug#4 details:
    level: critical
    state: unsolved

    this also happens while switching the gallery mode,
    the pivot point of the zoom is changed and considerably pushed to the left,
    and it's not even fixed by resetting the zoom view with ZoomView.reset.
